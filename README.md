### enableFrictionlessRequests

This command ensures that news feed requests are "frictionless" in that it
enables users to send requests to specific friends without having to click on a
pop-up confirmation dialog

```javascript
intel.xdk.facebook.enableFrictionlessRequests();
```

#### Description

This command ensures that news feed requests are "frictionless" in that it
enables users to send requests to specific friends without having to click on a
pop-up confirmation dialog. This command option is for iOS only since Android

### login

This method logs the user into Facebook

```javascript
intel.xdk.facebook.login(permissions);
```

#### Description

This command is used to log the user into Facebook. When it is run, a dialog
generated by Facebook should appear allowing the user to enter their
credentials. Depending on the result of that interaction with Facebook, the
application will receive a JavaScript event (intel.xdk.facebook.login)
indicating whether the login was successful or not. This method will log the
user in with a series of default permissions if no permissions parameter is
specified.

#### Platforms

-   Apple iOS
-   Google Android

#### Events

-   **[intel.xdk.facebook.login](#login):** This event is fired upon completion
    of the interaction with Facebook and will indicate either successful login
    or failure.

#### Example

```javascript
alert("about to log into facebook");
document.addEventListener("intel.xdk.facebook.login",function(e){
        if (e.success == true)
        { console.log("Facebook Log in Successful"); }
